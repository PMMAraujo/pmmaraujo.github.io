Thus, the existence of geographic hotspots of subtype diversity deepens the complexity of HIV-1/AIDS control. The already high subtype diversity in Portugal seems to be increasing due to infections with sub-subtype A1 virus. We performed phylogenetic analysis of 65 A1 sequences newly obtained from 14 Portuguese hospitals and 425 closely related database sequences. 80% of the A1 Portuguese isolates gathered in a main phylogenetic clade (MA1). Six transmission clusters were identified in MA1, encompassing isolates from Portugal, Spain, France, and United Kingdom. The most common transmission route identified was men who have sex with men. The origin of the MA1 was linked to Greece, with the first introduction to Portugal dating back to 1996 (95% HPD: 1993.6-1999.2). Individuals infected with MA1 virus revealed lower viral loads and higher CD4(+) T-cell counts in comparison with those infected by subtype B. The expanding A1 clusters in Portugal are connected to other European countries and share a recent common ancestor with the Greek A1 outbreak. The recent expansion of this HIV-1 subtype might be related to a slower disease progression leading to a population level delay in its diagnostic.","tags":null,"title":"Characterization of a large cluster of HIV-1 A1 infections detected in Portugal and connected to several Western European countries.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro M M Araujo","Luis Pinto da Silva","Joaquim C G Esteves da Silva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"d3256cce434e6fc894ba200e78cb7312","permalink":"https://pmmaraujo.github.io/publication/araujo-2015/","publishdate":"2019-06-20T22:58:05.067796Z","relpermalink":"/publication/araujo-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"MK2 (or MAPKAPK2) was already known for its role in the inflammatory response, however recent studies indicate the involvement of this protein kinase in the DNA damage response mechanism. Within its kinase family the enzyme MK3 shows the highest identity with MK2. Here we report a theoretical study on the binding of two molecules, 05B and P4O, to the proteins MK2 and MK3. The data here obtained may shed light on the contribution of individual residues and binding site water molecules for the binding of potential inhibitors to these two kinases.","tags":["Binding Sites","Dose-Response Relationship","Drug","Humans","Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Models","Molecular","Molecular Structure","Protein Binding","Protein Kinase Inhibitors","Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases","Structure-Activity Relationship","antagonists \u0026 inhibitors","chemical synthesis","chemistry","metabolism","pharmacology"],"title":"Theoretical analysis of the binding of potential inhibitors to protein kinases MK2 and MK3.","type":"publication"}]
